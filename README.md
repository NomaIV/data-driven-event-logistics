# Data Driven Corporate Event Logistics | Unilever Sports Day Case Study

## Project Overview
**Objective:** To plan an inclusive, logistically feasible Sports Day for a Unilever manufacturing site with **over 1,000 employees**. The core challenge was to translate unknown employee preferences into a viable schedule and activity roster within a fixed timeframe.

**My Role:** Data Analyst & Project Support (within HR/People team)  
**Tools:** Microsoft 365 (Forms, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive)  
**Key Skills Demonstrated:** Survey Analytics, Data Modelling, Operational Planning, Stakeholder Communication

## The Business Problem
Planning a large-scale event without data leads to either low participation or logistical failure. Specific constraints included:
*   **Scale:** 1,000+ potential participants across multiple departments.
*   **Varied Demand:** Unknown interest levels across 10+ sporting codes (e.g., football requiring 11 people per team vs. relay requiring 4).
*   **Fixed Resources:** A single-day event with limited fields/courts and time (6-hour window).
*   **Success Metric:** Maximise participation and enjoyment while ensuring all activities run smoothly.

## My Analytical Approach
### 1. **Data Collection & Engineering**
*   **Instrument:** Designed a structured Microsoft Forms survey distributed company-wide.
*   **Metrics Captured:**
    *   Employee interest per sporting code (multi-select).
    *   Departmental affiliation.
    *   Availability confirmation.
*   **Outcome:** Generated the primary dataset linking **demand** (interest) to **demographic** (department) for analysis.

### 2. **Data Analysis & Modelling**
*   **Tool:** Microsoft Excel (Primary analysis engine).
*   **Key Analyses Performed:**
    *   **Activity Viability Analysis:** Created a model comparing `COUNTIF` totals of interest per sport against minimum player requirements. This automatically flagged sports with insufficient sign-ups.
    *   **Departmental Participation Heatmap:** Used PivotTables to visualise interest density across departments, ensuring no team was critically under-represented.
    *   **Popularity Ranking & Resource Allocation:** Sorted activities by popularity to prioritise scheduling and allocate prime time slots to high-demand sports.
    *   **Time-Constraint Modelling:** Built a simple scheduling matrix in Excel to test how many matches/rounds of each viable sport could fit into the day.

  ### 3. **Insights & Decision Support**
The analysis provided clear, actionable intelligence:
*   **Quantified Demand:** Identified the top 5 most popular sports and, crucially, **2 non-viable activities** that were removed from the plan, saving budget and management focus.
*   **Stakeholder Reporting:** Synthesised findings into a PowerPoint deck for HR and site leadership, visually presenting the recommendation: **"A schedule of 8 sports, with a predicted participation rate of 88% based on survey data."**
*   **Process Documentation:** All data, analysis, and final documents were centralised on OneDrive, creating an auditable trail and a template for future events.



## Impact & Outcome
*   **Informed Decision-Making:** Leadership approved the plan without revision, based on its clear data-backed rationale.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** The event ran to schedule with no last-minute cancellations or resource shortages.
*   **Increased Engagement:** High participation rates were achieved as the programme reflected actual employee preferences.
*   **Legacy Asset:** The analysis model and survey framework were saved as reusable templates for future site events.

## Skills Highlighted
*   **Data Analysis & Modelling:** Transforming raw survey data into strategic insights using Excel.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Applying logical constraints (time, player numbers) to a dataset to produce a feasible solution.
*   **Visualisation & Communication:** Creating clear charts and presentations for non-technical stakeholders.
*   **Project Lifecycle Management:** Ownership from data collection through to execution support.
